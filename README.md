Git is Awesome!!!

What is Git?
Git (typically all lowercase) is a software program that helps you and your team manage and keep track of changes to files (aka "version control").

GitHub is a website where you can store your git information as a back-up or for sharing. Why is it useful?
1. It helps you know what is the current version of a file, avoiding folders full of "v2", "final" and the inevitable "final v2"
2. It helps you know what is different between two versions (e.g., it answers the question, "It worked last time, what changed?") 
3. If two people are both updating a file, it helps you manage any differences between their versions
